# Changelog

This file documents all notable changes made to ITFlow.

## [Unreleased] ITFlow Internal IT - Roles: module-only logins contained, checked surfaces, Assets module
Database 2.6.94 -> 2.6.95 (new module `module_assets`; every existing role is granted it at its current Tickets/assets/docs
level, so nobody's access changes). Apply it through **Admin > Update > Update Database**; until it has run, asset pages
keep working through Tickets/assets/docs. Phase 5's planned migration moves to 2.6.96.

### Security
- A module-only login (a role with none of Departments, Tickets/assets/docs and Assets - e.g. Training only) now gets
  only its own modules' pages, its account and its notifications. Everything else answers 403 with a "Go to Training"
  page (JSON for pop-ups and ajax). Its sidebar shows only its modules (no Dashboard, Work or custom links), the logo,
  sign-in and `/` go to its own home, `dashboard.php?home=1` no longer shows the dashboard, the search box is hidden,
  and notifications (bell, page, phone push, app API) carry only its modules' types. Its app API token may use only
  `me`, `notifications` and `kb`/`reports`/`alerts` for modules it holds.
- Checked for everyone: search (page and live) section by section; contact and asset details, company-wide People,
  contracts and onboarding/offboarding runs; the calendar (Tickets/assets/docs, each built-in feed by its module; the
  Work group only with Tickets/assets/docs); adding/editing/deleting calendar events, adding tags and categories,
  turning off shared links and ticket-viewer tracking; dashboard widgets by module with ticket widgets scoped to the
  user's departments; department overview cards; app API search, dashboard and v2 workflow runs.
- Denials are HTTP 403 with a proper page in the app shell and no leftover "not permitted" message on the next page;
  the admin area's denial too. Opening the Credentials page no longer logs a view before the permission check.
- Sidebar: Trips sits inside the Finance check, Intune Devices needs Departments.

### New Features & Updates
- **Assets** module (levels 1-3): asset pages without tickets. Asset lists, details, edits, imports/exports, inline
  edit, search and the dashboard accept Assets or Tickets/assets/docs. With Assets alone, an asset's linked tickets,
  documents, files, licenses and services are not shown.
- Training > **Training settings** in the sidebar for Training level 3.
- App API `GET /api/v1/me` adds `is_admin`, `limited` and `permissions` (every module with its level 0-3).

## [Unreleased] ITFlow Internal IT - Training kiosk: temporary and unlisted devices
Database 2.6.93 -> 2.6.94 (`training_kiosks`: `kiosk_asset_id` and `kiosk_asset_type` become NULL-able, new
`kiosk_expires_at_utc` and index `idx_training_kiosk_expires`). Apply it through **Admin > Update > Update Database**;
until it has run the kiosk answers 404 and the cron skips, as before 2.6.93. Phase 5's planned migration moves to 2.6.95.

### New Features & Updates
- Set up this device: **This device isn't in Assets** enrolls a device by name only ("Trainer's laptop", "Borrowed
  iPad"). It is always shared (no personal-device mode), no asset lockout checks apply, and each one is independent of the
  one-device-per-asset rule. The Devices tab and the kiosk evidence on training records show its name and "Not in Assets".
- **Temporary** devices (listed or unlisted): until the end of today, 4 / 8 / 24 hours, or a date and time up to 30 days
  away (app time zone). Past that time the device is revoked on its next request (open kiosk session ended, start URL
  dead, "This device is not set up for training"), and `cron/training_kiosk_cron.php` revokes untouched ones every 10
  minutes with the reason "Temporary device expired" (ledger and audit like a manual revoke, system actor). The Devices tab
  shows a **Temporary** badge and "Temporary · expires ..." (amber in its last hour) / "Expired", with **Change end time**
  (current end, a live preview of the new one, an earlier time flagged as **Shorten it**), **End now**, and **Remove now**
  for an expired device nobody touched yet. A permanent device can get an end time later (**Set end time**). The setup
  success panel shows the end time; every time shows the zone in force at that time. "Until the end of today" needs 5
  minutes left today, and a setup code's device must last at least as long as the code (15 minutes).
- On the kiosk, a temporary device shows "This device: ... · until 3:13 PM" on the sign-in screen and in trainer mode, an
  "Ends 3:13 PM" chip in its last 15 minutes, and afterwards "This device's training time is over" with the time it ended.
- Training records say "temporary device" only when the device was temporary when the person signed (from the ledger),
  and show an unlisted device's number ("Not in Assets (device #12)").
- Same permission as enrollment (Training kiosk level 3). New agent action `kiosk_set_expiry`; new ledger event type
  `kiosk.expiry_changed`. The in-app Setup guide and `docs/training-kiosk-setup.md` have a "Temporary or unlisted devices"
  section.

## [Unreleased] ITFlow Internal IT - Training (LMS) Phases 3+4: kiosk, learner flow, achievement awards, trainer mode
Database 2.6.92 -> 2.6.93 (13 new tables, 21 settings columns). Apply it only through **Admin > Update > Update
Database**; fresh installs get the same schema from `db.sql`. The kiosk answers only while the Training module is on,
and Odoo-PIN sign-in stays off (`config_training_odoo_pin_enabled = 0`) until the owner switches it on.

### New Features & Updates
- Training kiosk at `/kiosk/` for shop iPads and Windows PCs (outside `/agent/`): an admin enrolls the device while
  signed in on it and gets a permanent start URL (`/kiosk/?d=<token>` for the Edge/Chrome kiosk-mode start page; the
  server answers it with a bare redirect to `/kiosk/#d=<token>`, and the nginx rule keeps it out of the access log);
  employees type their name, then their PIN. Local PINs come from printed setup slips; Odoo-PIN sign-in is
  built in behind a switch. Lockouts per person, per device and site-wide, with Clear cooldown / Clear pause.
- Learning Center (required, due soon, documents to sign, my courses, certificates, badges, PIN-change notices), the
  course player with server-credited lesson time, final exams with saved answers, time limits and attempt limits, a
  separate YouTube/Vimeo lesson page, finger signature + PIN sign-off, and a receipt with the certificate number. English
  and Spanish throughout.
- Records: a kiosk sign-off issues the Phase 2 completion (certificate, assignment closed); the record page shows the
  kiosk evidence (lesson time, attempts, signatures). People and departments with kiosk evidence cannot be hard-deleted.
- Achievement awards: automatic badges (course, category, path, course count, perfect score, first-try pass, on-time
  streak), manual badges from the agent page or by a trainer on the kiosk, shown on the result screen, receipt,
  Learning Center and transcript.
- Trainer mode on the kiosk: run a session and pass the iPad around for check-in (signature + PIN), finish with the
  trainer's signature and PIN, practical evaluations with an employee hand-off, check-in from a second device.
- Agent pages: Devices & PINs (enroll, revoke, new start URL, setup slips, unlock), Locked courses (+N attempts or
  restart), Awarded badges. Admin > Training kiosk for idle times, session caps and lockout thresholds.
- Cron: new `cron/training_kiosk_cron.php` (every 10 minutes; see its header for the cron.d line and log file).
- Publishing: a lesson quick check marked "must pass" is refused for now (the kiosk does not run quick checks yet);
  other quick checks publish with a warning.

### Fixes (Phase 3+4 end-to-end QA)
- Kiosk course pages on a portrait iPad (768-834 px wide) now use the player's narrow layout: the video, PDF and article
  side panels move below the lesson, and the lesson and quiz footers wrap instead of cutting off buttons or squeezing
  the "Available after ..." text. The header no longer clips the brand in Spanish.
- A Spanish screen shows Spanish course names and "Pick up at" lesson titles in the Learning Center (cards, completed
  courses, certificates) wherever the course has them.
- Blended courses (a class or hands-on evaluation still to come): the kiosk sign-off statement says the employee
  completed the online part, and the receipt preview no longer promises a certificate and expiry at signing.
- Trainer session header shows the date as "Sep 25, 2026" instead of 2026-09-25.
- Rule editor: "Change on the course" opened a "course no longer exists" page; it now opens the course Settings tab.

### Fixes (Phase 3+4 security and employee-UX review)
- Security: a flood of bogus start-URL adoptions no longer blocks real devices (a valid token is never rate-limited;
  only unknown tokens count). Check-in and hand-off can only be left with the trainer PIN (or a genuine idle timeout):
  `/kiosk/?switch=1` and a direct sign-out are refused there. A trainer needs the evaluate permission, the course and the
  person's department to record a hands-on pass/fail in a session, re-checked when the session is finished. The
  YouTube/Vimeo lesson page runs sandboxed without pop-ups, so the video provider's script cannot open another kiosk
  page. `/kiosk/?d=<token>` is redirected before any page renders; add the nginx rule in the release notes.
- Lessons in an in-order course no longer offer "Next lesson" before the lesson is done (it used to drop people back
  on the course page); acknowledgment lessons have the Sign button in the always-visible footer with a to-do line
  ("Tick the box, sign, then enter your PIN"), and say "Step 1 of 2" when the course sign-off follows.
- Two-language courses ask "English / Español" at the first Start; a course with nothing done yet follows a language
  change; otherwise the course page says why it stays in the language it was started in.
- Course page: a "My training" button back to the Learning Center. PDF lessons fill the width with the page counter
  and thumbnails always visible. Uploaded videos have a big Play button. Exam wording ("Start the exam"), no duplicate
  "Final exam" heading or attempts count, and a failed exam offers "Back to course".
- Sign page: the keypad fits its card, keys stay readable before signing with "Sign first, then enter your PIN here",
  Sign & finish stays on screen, and the signed statement reads "September 25, 2026" / "25 de septiembre de 2026".
- Spanish: the header button is "Salir"; learner messages say "instructor", "examen" and "este dispositivo". Windows
  PCs say "with the mouse" and "Use the arrows to turn pages"; trainer screens say "this device" instead of "iPad".
- Info messages use a neutral blue instead of the theme colour (on a red theme they looked like errors); the company
  logo shows in the kiosk header; courses without a cover get their own colour and initials; chips, labels and the
  signature hint are larger and higher-contrast; the "Still there?" seconds count down.
- Sign-in: on a touch screen the heading shrinks while typing a name so results stay above the on-screen keyboard;
  on a PC, Enter picks a single match and digits typed before the keypad appears are kept. After Done, the sign-in
  screen goes back to the default language. Check-in says "Type your name to check in" when there is no list and no
  longer shows the trainer's name in the header; evaluation results read "Passed" / "Did not pass".

## [Unreleased] ITFlow Internal IT - Training (LMS) Phase 2: assignments, compliance, records and reports
Database 2.6.91 -> 2.6.92. Apply it only through **Admin > Update > Update Database** (the migration block in
`admin/database_updates.php`; fresh installs get the same schema from `db.sql`). Nothing changes for users until the
Training module is on.

### New Features & Updates
- Training: requirement rules (department, Odoo job, Odoo work location, job group, specific people, or everyone on the
  roster; new hires only; due-date policy; live preview) and an assignment engine that opens, renews, reopens, reissues
  and closes assignments from the records (nightly, and after every rule, roster, record or directory change).
- Training: completion records with LMS certificate numbers and verify tokens, office entry of external cards and paper
  records with an evidence scan, practical evaluations, attended sessions with an attested, digest-frozen finalize, void
  with reissue, and hard-delete protection for people and departments with records.
- Training: overview dashboard (KPIs, department x course heatmap, overdue ageing, expiring 30/60/90, trend), reports
  with CSV (matrix, overdue, expiring, course analytics, document acknowledgments), transcript, printable certificate
  with QR, and a Training panel on the contact page.
- Training: Assignments, People (roster, job groups, trainers, hire dates), Records & sessions pages; side-nav overdue
  badge and dashboard chips; training-only roles land on the Training overview.
- Contacts: the Add Contact form has a Start Date (hire date), as the edit form already did; with Training on, a new
  contact is matched against the assignment rules as soon as it is saved.
- Admin > Training compliance: compliance defaults, the opt-in hire-date fill from Odoo, Odoo employee link check and
  resolution (a changed Odoo database blocks the directory sync until the links are checked), Recalculate now,
  Capture today's snapshot, and the nightly Odoo directory sync switch (off by default).
- Cron: `cron/training_cron.php` also reconciles assignments and captures the daily compliance snapshot;
  new `cron/odoo_sync_cron.php` (inert until switched on).
- Training: department job groups. Every active department gets its own job group, created and kept in step for you
  (renamed, archived and restored with the department). Its people are the department's contacts right now, so a new
  hire or a department move takes effect at once. A rule on a department group matches the same people as a
  Department condition, also after the department is archived. People › Job groups now has two sections, "Your
  groups" (with New job group) and "Department groups" (view-only; each lists its people, links to the department,
  lists the rules that use it and offers "New rule for this group"). Users limited to some departments see only
  their departments' groups. The rule editor's group picker groups them under headings with the same people counts
  as the tiles. The Microsoft and Google directory syncs now recalculate assignments right away, as the Odoo sync
  does. No database change: the link is a reserved row in the job-group titles table that no real job title can match.
